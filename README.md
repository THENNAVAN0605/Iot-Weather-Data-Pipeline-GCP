# Iot-Weather-Data-Pipeline-GCP
This project demonstrates a full-stack IoT + Cloud Data Engineering pipeline that collects real-time temperature and humidity data from a Raspberry Pi (with DHT22 sensor) and processes it using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. The data is streamed, processed, stored, and visualized â€” all in real time.
